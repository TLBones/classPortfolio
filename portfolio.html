                This portfolio site was designed, built, and completely created by me. Every small factor, built over the course of my education with Salt Lake Community College. <br> To see more of my updated projects, visit my GitHub page: <a target="_blank"

            <h4>Teds Tree</h4>
            <p>
                Teds Tree was a first. A project that would push my personal limits beyond what I had previously done. I learned primarily from watching YouTube Videos and copying the code, and then pushing the code past that boundary to ensure I understood the logic
                behind it. If you would like to see the product-to-date click <a target="_blank" href="https://www.teds-tree.com">here.</a> This project is still growing, and is in use to assist my fellow classmates and peers in their
                learning and socializing. Built on Django, this project certainly forwarded my knowledge of both Python, and HTML.
