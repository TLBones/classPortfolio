                    I am Theodore Bonham, a young and adaptable worker looking to forward my career and experiences. I have been self-teaching myself to code in HTML5, CSS, javascript, and Python on and off for 4 years now, and have quite a wide variety of experiences and
                    skills to bring with it. A drive to succeed is one of the highest priorities that I hold. I am looking for a team that I can stay with for a long time, helping both myself and the team grow and prosper.

                    About Me
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Ever since I was a kid, I've been around computers. When I was 2 my father got me my first computer, and I loved it. Ever since I've been working with and on computers. I took a class back in high school, basic computer science, and with that I learned
                    about the basics of javascript. I loved the class, and all of the projects we developed in it, I became enthralled with the idea- but slowly fell out of practice with school demanding other things of me at the time. Over the past year
                    I have been working five times harder to attempt to catch back up. Python has become a very powerful drive, and I have been driving my education with it on my own. I also reached out to SLCC and took the Web Development and Design
                    course for my certificate of proficiency. With that said, I am excited to further my learning and experience and look forward to hearing from you! This site was fully built by me, and will be undergoing further experiments and designs
                    as I progress.
                    </br> Thank you for your time, have a nice day.
