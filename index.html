            About Theodore
        </h1>
        <p>
            I am Theodore Bonham, a young and adaptable worker looking to forward my career and experiences. I have been self-teaching myself to code in HTML5, CSS, javascript, and Python on and off for 4 years now, and have quite a wide variety of experiences and
            skills to bring with it. A drive to succeed is one of the highest priorities that I hold. I am looking for a team that I can stay with for a long time, helping both myself and the team grow and prosper.
